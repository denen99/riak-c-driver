--- 1. Overview ---
Riak[1] is a No-SQL database, which emphasizes on replication and data distribution. This driver/library provides means to communicate with Riak instances using cURL[2]. In fact it works as cURL wrapper and HTTP response parser. Originally this library was created during attempts of benchmarking Riak in comaprison to MongoDB[3] and MySQL[4] and it was decided that it deserves being a separate project. ;)
Right now this driver provides very limited functionality, but it's definitely something to start with.

--- 2. Requirements ---
Dependencies for this project: (header files required for compilation)
- cURL
- json-c[5]

C standard library is also required. Library was tested with gcc but it should work fine with other C compilers.

--- 3. Installation ---

Just type
$ make
and then (as superuser)
# make install

This will create dynamic-linked library libriakdrv.so and copy it to PREFIX/lib (default PREFIX: /usr/local). Additionaly riakdrv.h header file will be copied to PREFIX/include.

If you want to uninstall the library, use
# make uninstall
This will erase both .so and .h file.

--- 4. Usage ---

To use the library, just include riakdrv.h header file and add -lriakdrv to your linker parameters.

Coming soon: API documentation.

--- 5. TODO list ---
- multiple connection support
- getting JSON from DB by key
- error handling
- logging
- tests
- detailed API description

- aided MapReduce statement creation?

--- 6. Buglist ---
Probably too many to list. :) It's very alpha version though...
